# Macro Meal Planning 
 

## Simple python utility for mapping out macros in advance


When planning out my macros I find it easier to have a simple script 
I can run, make small tweaks to foods and amounts, and run again. 

For me this is faster than entering things into the [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) or
[LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/) UI,
finding out I've missed a target by 25 g, and having to click around 
the UI to try and fix it. (I love both myfitnesspal and LoseIt; can't decide which I like better :).

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| utilities.py | a few utilities: macros dictionaries for my common foods, some functions for calculating meal and daily macros |
| monday.py...sunday.py | script to estimate macros for the day, broken down into meals |

My workflow: edit the day's script (i.e. monday.py) to enter my meal plan
for the day, run the script, tweak amounts/foods if needed to meet my 
macro targets, repeat as needed.
